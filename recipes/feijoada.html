        <h3> <p> <em> Feijoada </em> is prepared with black beans, a variety of pork or beef, bacon, smoked pork ribs. The final dish has the beans and meat pieces barely covered by a dark purplish-brown broth. </p> 
        <p>The taste is strong. It is customary to serve it with fried collards and white rice. As a celebratory dish, feijoada is intended to be enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances.</p> </h3>
